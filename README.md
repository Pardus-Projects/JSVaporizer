# NuFlexiArch + JSVapor

NuFlexiArch + JSVapor is an experimental, lightweight framework for building interactive web applications using C# and WebAssembly, without relying on higher-level abstractions like Blazor. It provides:

1. A **component model** (`NuFlexiArch`) to define and manage UI components, their data, and metadata.  
2. A **renderer** and **DOM interop layer** (`JSVapor`) to generate HTML, manipulate the DOM, and manage events directly through `[JSImport]` and `[JSExport]`.  
3. A **transformer system** for converting DTOs (data transfer objects) to JSON or views, supporting a registry of transformers.  

The goal is to give developers fine-grained control over the DOM while avoiding large amounts of “spaghetti JavaScript” by writing most application logic in C#.

## Features

- **C#-First Approach**: Consolidate your UI logic, event handling, and rendering in C#.  
- **Component Architecture**: Build components that inherit from an abstract `AComponent` and manage their own state (`CompDataDto`) and metadata.  
- **Custom Rendering**: Render HTML through `IComponentRenderer` implementations that generate DOM elements on the fly.  
- **Fine-Grained DOM Control**: Use `[JSImport]` calls for direct DOM manipulation with minimal overhead or abstraction.  
- **Event Handling**: Attach C# event handlers to DOM events via an event pool, eliminating the need for raw JavaScript event listeners.  
- **DTO to JSON**: Serialize and deserialize component state with strongly typed data-transfer objects using System.Text.Json source generation.  
- **Registry & Transformers**: Dynamically switch between transformers to convert JSON strings into component DTOs (or vice versa).

---

## Project Structure

This framework is split across three main namespaces (and corresponding files/folders):

1. **NuFlexiArch**  
   - Defines the *core abstractions* for components (`AComponent`, `IComponentRenderer`, `CompDataDto`, etc.)  
   - Handles serialization/deserialization (`CompMetadata`, `CompInstanceDto`, JSON contexts).

2. **JSVNuFlexiArch**  
   - Contains *concrete WASM-focused components* (e.g., `JSVSlider`, `JSVTextDisplay`) that build upon `NuFlexiArch`.  
   - Uses the `JSVapor` API to create DOM elements, attach events, etc.

3. **JSVapor** (or **JSVaporizer**)  
   - The low-level *DOM interop layer* for .NET WASM.  
   - Provides classes like `Document`, `Element`, `Window` and direct `[JSImport]` references to JavaScript.  
   - Manages event listener pools and function pools to coordinate DOM events and callback invocation in C#.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - .NET 7 (or higher) SDK  
   - A browser environment that supports WebAssembly and the new `System.Runtime.InteropServices.JavaScript` features.  

2. **Cloning the Repository**

    git clone https://github.com/PardusLabs/ZenArch.git  
    cd NuFlexiArch-JSVapor

3. **Building**  
   - Open the solution (or project) in Visual Studio / VS Code / JetBrains Rider.  
   - Build the project. This should produce a WASM application that you can serve or run.

4. **Running**  
   - Depending on your setup, you might have a `dotnet run` project or a static host for the generated WASM.  
   - In many .NET WASM templates, you’ll do something like:

        dotnet run --project MyWasmProject

   - Then navigate to the displayed local URL (e.g., `https://localhost:5001`).

5. **Creating a Custom Component**  
   - Inherit from `AComponent` (or a specialized base like `ASlider`).  
   - Define your own DTO class (e.g. `public class MyCompDataDto : CompDataDto { ... }`).  
   - Provide an implementation for `UpdateState()` and `GetState()`.  
   - Optionally override `Initialize()` to attach event listeners or do post-render actions.  
   - Create a matching renderer implementing `IComponentRenderer` (or extend `JSVComponentRenderer`).

---

## How It Works

1. **Define** a Component  
   - For example, `JSVSlider` inherits from `ASlider`. It keeps track of `_value`, `_labelValue`, etc.

2. **Render** to the Browser  
   - A `JSVSliderRenderer` creates the HTML markup for your slider.  
   - You call `JSVapor.Document.CreateElement`, set properties, add attributes, etc.  
   - The markup is placed in the DOM by calling `AppendChild` or setting `innerHTML`.

3. **Attach Event Handlers**  
   - In `Initialize()`, a slider can register a "change" listener to update the C# `_value`.  
   - This uses `JSVapor.Element.AddEventListener` plus the event pool `WasmJSVEventHandlerPool`.

4. **Update State**  
   - When an event triggers, the component updates its internal data.  
   - Any secondary UI (e.g., a text display showing the slider value) can be synced as well.

5. **Serialize / Deserialize**  
   - If needed, the component’s `CompDataDto` (e.g. `SliderDataDto`) can be serialized to JSON.  
   - This enables storing/restoring UI states or sending state to other services.

## Roadmap

1. **Additional Components**  
   - Buttons, dropdowns, text inputs, checkboxes, etc.

2. **Lifecycle Hooks**  
   - Provide a more robust lifecycle (e.g., `OnRender`, `OnAfterRender`, `OnDispose`) for better resource management.

3. **Routing / Navigation**  
   - Potentially integrate with a lightweight routing system.

4. **Improved Error Handling & Logging**  
   - More graceful handling of DOM operations or events that fail.

5. **Tooling / CLI**  
   - Possibly a CLI or templates for easier scaffolding of new components.
