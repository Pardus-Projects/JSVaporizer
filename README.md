# ZenArch

**A unified, data-centric .NET WebAssembly framework to tame large-scale front-end complexity.**  
Derived from the fusion of **NuFlexiArch** (transformers + components) and **JSVaporizer** (minimal .NET↔JS interop), **ZenArch** is designed to help teams avoid spaghetti code, reduce redundant JavaScript, and scale cleanly across big business applications or distributed microservice architectures.

## Overview

**ZenArch** combines:
- **NuFlexiArch**: A flexible, DTO-centric architecture that uses “components” and “transformers” to structure your application’s data flow.  
- **JSVaporizer**: A lightweight .NET-to-JavaScript interop layer that drastically reduces the need for raw JavaScript, exposing DOM actions and event handling in a clear, minimal API.

This synergy provides a **structured, scalable** foundation to manage complex front-end logic for **large-scale business apps** or distributed systems. Using **ZenArch**, teams can keep code modular, minimize debugging overhead, and consistently handle data transformations from server to UI.

---

## Key Goals

1. **Eliminate Spaghetti Code**  
   - Ensure that even when an application grows to hundreds of modules or microservices, front-end code remains predictable and maintainable.

2. **DTO-Centric Data Flow**  
   - Keep data transformations explicit. All JSON ↔ application state ↔ UI transitions happen in well-defined “transformer” methods.

3. **Minimal JavaScript**  
   - Avoid scattering JS across the project. Use ephemeral `JSObject`s and dictionary-based event delegation so C# handles DOM and events directly.

4. **Scalable for Teams**  
   - Encourage a **common pattern** so new developers easily onboard, find relevant code, and follow consistent method signatures (`JsonToDto`, `DtoToView`, etc.).

5. **AI-Assisted Development**  
   - Provide clear patterns that AI tools (like ChatGPT or Copilot) can grasp, generating or refactoring code in a straightforward, minimal-boilerplate manner.

## Why ZenArch?

- **Structured Architecture**: By merging data transformations (NuFlexiArch) with a minimal interop layer (JSVaporizer), you achieve a system designed for large codebases—no need for a monolithic front-end.
- **AOT Friendly**: Built on .NET WASM technology; source-generated JSON contexts help with performance and smaller WASM footprints.
- **Clean Separation**: Components handle UI state, Transformers handle data logic, DOM calls remain in C#—makes for a more maintainable codebase.
- **Ideal for Distributed Systems**: Integrates easily with microservices that pass JSON; simply feed the JSON into a transformer to update your front-end logic or UI.

## ZenArch vs. Blazor vs. React

| **Category**                  | **ZenArch (NuFlexiArch + JSVaporizer)**                                                                                                      | **Blazor**                                                                                             | **React**                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Language**         | **C#** (headless components, separate minimal JS interop)                                                                                     | **C#** (components, Razor syntax)                                                                       | **JavaScript/TypeScript** (functional or class-based components)                                            |
| **Approach**                 | Headless, DTO-centric. You define data structures (DTOs) and component logic. A separate “renderer” (e.g., browser, CLI, desktop) handles UI.  | Full-stack .NET SPA approach, leveraging Razor components.                                              | UI library for building declarative UIs. Often combined with other libraries (Redux, Router, etc.) to form a full SPA. |
| **Rendering Model**          | **Manually controlled**. Uses JSVaporizer for DOM, but can also adapt to non-browser contexts (e.g., CLI or desktop) without major changes.     | **Declarative** with built-in rendering and partial re-renders based on diffing.                         | **Virtual DOM** diffing. Components re-render when state or props change.                                    |
| **Data Flow & State**        | Custom `SetState()`/`GetState()` in each component (DTO-based). Potentially more manual, but flexible and testable—supports nested or composite components. | Typically uses `[Parameter]`, `@bind`, and component lifecycle methods (`OnInitialized`, `OnParametersSet`). | Uses component state (hooks or classes) and props; advanced state mgmt often uses Redux or similar.         |
| **Interop with JS**          | Lightweight: ephemeral `JSObject`s + `[JSImport]` / `[JSExport]`. Minimal overhead, direct DOM calls if in a browser. No forced JS usage if on other platforms. | Provided by Blazor's built-in JS interop, but typically you stay in C#.                                  | Native JS environment (browser). For external services or advanced logic, you rely on JavaScript/TypeScript. |
| **Non-Browser Platforms**    | **Yes**: Because it's headless, you can theoretically integrate with CLI, WPF/WinForms, or other .NET front ends. No DOM calls required.        | Primarily web-focused (Blazor Server/WASM). For desktop/CLI, you’d typically revert to .NET MAUI or other frameworks. | React can be extended with React Native for mobile, but it’s still JS-based. No official .NET or CLI approach. |

| **Deployment & Hosting**     | - For web: .NET WebAssembly or server-based .NET + minimal JS<br>- For non-browser: standard .NET deployment (e.g. desktop, console)           | - Deploy as static files (Blazor WASM) or with ASP.NET (Blazor Server)                                  | - Plain static hosting, Node.js environment, or any standard web host                                        |
| **Community & Support**      | - Smaller, custom approach<br>- Dependent on your own docs & any early adopters                                                               | - Official Microsoft backing, decent enterprise adoption                                                | - Huge open-source community, robust corporate usage, many 3rd-party services                               |

### Key Takeaways

- **ZenArch (NuFlexiArch + JSVaporizer)**  
  - **Best if** you want a flexible, **headless** approach in C# that can be adapted to multiple platforms (web, desktop, CLI). For web-based DOM work, you have full low-level control, but it’s more **manual**.  
  - **Trade-off**: Smaller ecosystem, less “turnkey” than Blazor or React.  

- **Blazor**  
  - **Best if** you want a fairly “turnkey” .NET web solution with Razor-based syntax and official Microsoft support.  
  - **Trade-off**: Primarily targets web scenarios. You rely on Blazor’s lifecycle and might have less direct DOM control.

- **React**  
  - **Best if** you prefer JavaScript/TypeScript and value the huge ecosystem. Declarative virtual DOM suits many web apps, and React Native extends to mobile.  
  - **Trade-off**: Not .NET-based, so C# devs must context-switch. For desktop or CLI, you’d need an entirely different solution.

## Core Concepts

### DTO-Centric Architecture

At the heart of **ZenArch** is the idea that **data** flows through discrete objects (DTOs) rather than scattered variables. By converting to and from JSON, these DTOs are easily transported between microservices or stored for offline scenarios.

### NuFlexiArch Components & Transformers

1. **Components**  
   - Subclass `AComponent` or implement `IComponent`. This is where you define how your “module” or “feature” organizes data (`SetState`, `GetState`) and, optionally, how it “renders” (if it needs to show a UI).

2. **Transformers**  
   - Classes that implement methods like `JsonToDto` (load data from JSON), `DtoToView` (write data to the DOM), `ViewToDto` (read DOM back to data), and `DtoToJson` (serialize data).  
   - Each transformer can be **registered** in a `TransformerRegistry` under a unique string key, making it easy to swap or update transformations without large code changes.

### JSVaporizer DOM Interop

- **Ephemeral `JSObject`s**: Every time you call `Document.AssertGetElementById(...)`, you get a short-lived handle disposed after usage—so you avoid memory leaks or stale references.  
- **Dictionary-Based Events**: Instead of multiple `[JSExport]` handlers, store them in a dictionary keyed by a string. JavaScript can invoke them by calling `WasmExports.CallJSVEventHandler("myEventKey", ...)`.  
- **Minimal JS**: In many cases, you only need small stubs on the JS side—like an `AjaxPOST` function—while all front-end logic and event wiring remains in your .NET code.

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise Forms**: Large forms with multiple steps, validations, and dynamic data from microservices.  
- **IoT Dashboards**: Transform sensor data (JSON) into DOM updates, allowing real-time or event-driven UI changes with minimal JS.  
- **Multi-Step Wizards**: Keep each step as a component, store or reuse partial data in DTOs, and easily re-sequence steps as business rules change.  
- **Collaborative Apps**: Manage multiple user inputs via distributed JSON updates (like a collaborative whiteboard or doc editor).  
- **AI or External Service Calls**: Read data from an AI or external service (JSON), transform it for display, attach event handlers in .NET code, and push updates back.

## Advanced Topics

### AI-Assisted Development

ZenArc’s **regular, consistent** architecture is perfect for AI code generation:
- Predictable method signatures: `JsonToDto`, `DtoToView`, `ViewToDto`, etc.  
- Minimal JavaScript means an AI assistant can focus on generating or refactoring C# logic for data transformations or event handling.

### Multi-Service or Microservice Workflows

- Bring in **JSON** from multiple microservices → feed into transformers → unify the data in a single front end.  
- Each microservice’s schema can have a distinct “transformer” mapping fields to UI states, lowering integration friction.

### Handling Complex Forms

- Nest multiple “sub-components,” each with its own `CompStateDto`.  
- Compose them in a main “container” transformer or registry, letting you reorganize or reuse sub-components for different form flows.

---

## Roadmap

- **Performance Tuning** for large forms or data arrays.  
- **Additional Transformer Patterns** for partial or field-level updates.  
- **Deeper AI Integration**: Potential advanced code generation scripts for new fields or new event logic.  
- **Plugin Architecture**: A more formal plugin model for specialized transformers (e.g., file upload, chat integration).
